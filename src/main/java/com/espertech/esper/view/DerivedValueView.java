/**
 * Tag interface for derived-value views. Derived-value views follow the view interface and do not keep a window over the
 * data received by their parent view. They simply derive a set of data points from a stream and
 * do not retain events.
 * <p>
 * Derived-Value views generally follow the following behavior:
 * <p>
 * They publish the output data when receiving insert or remove stream data from their parent view,
 * directly and not time-driven.
 * <p>
 * They typically change event type compared to their parent view, since they derive new information
 * or add information to events.
